This is an in development mod package for screeps that can be used to add variation to leaderboards for private servers.

The first usage of this mod will be to store a score in the db for each user, every minute.
The score that is recorded will be as follows:
1 point per owned room with 4 sources.
2 points per owned room with 3 sources.
3 points per owned room with 2 sources.
4 points per owned room with 1 source.
